Installation:
=============

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

sysprompt> ./configure
sysprompt> make
sysprompt> make check
sysprompt> make install

Known to work with:
  - Linux/x86, EGCS-1.1.2 or GCC 2-95.

The "make" step takes about 10 minutes, on a 586 DX / 133 MHz / 64 MB or
about 2 minutes on a P-III /550 MHz / 512 MB.

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation,
in the doc/ directory.


Problems with CLN:
==================

You should use at least CLN V1.0.2, since all earlier ones are
somewhat buggy.  Even V1.0.1 has a few problems and GiNaC will not
support older versions.  Please install it properly on your system
before continuing with GiNaC.
