PREREQUISITES
=============

GiNaC requires the CLN library by Bruno Haible, available at either
one of the following FTP-sites:
  * <ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/gnu/>,
  * <ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/> or
  * <ftp://ftpthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/pub/gnu/>.
You will also need a decent ANSI-compliant C++-compiler.  We use
`post-EGCS' GCC, i.e GCC >= 2.95 for development so if you have a
different compiler you are on your own.  Note that you may have to use
the same compiler you compiled CLN with because of differing
name-mangling schemes.

Optionally, GiNaC may work together with Masaharu Goto's C++
interpreter cint (which requires that you register for commercial
use).  You may obtain it from
  * <ftp://root.cern.ch/root/>.
Install it by following the instructions included in Cint's
distribution before trying to compile GiNaC-cint.  (See section
`Working with the Cint C++ interpreter' below.)


INSTALLATION
============

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make check
[become root if necessary]
 $ make install

Known to work with:
  - Linux/x86, EGCS-1.1.2 or GCC 2-95.1/2-95.2

The "configure" script can be given a number of options to enable and
disable various features. For a complete list, type:

 $ ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

 --prefix=PREFIX        install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                        [defaults to /usr/local]
 --exec-prefix=EPREFIX  install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                        [defaults to the value given to --prefix]
 --disable-shared       suppress the creation of a shared version of libginac

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation,
in the doc/ directory.

The time the "make" step takes depends heavily on optimization levels.
Large amounts of memory (>128MB) will be required by the compiler,
also depending on optimization.  To give you a rough idea of what you
have to expect the following table may be helpful.  It was measured on
a P-III/500MHz with "enough" memory:

step:         | GCC optimization level:  | comment:
              |  -O0   |  -O1   |  -O2   |
--------------+--------+--------+--------+-------------------------------
make          |  ~4m   |  ~6m   |  ~10m  | building shared and static lib
make check    |  ~3m   |  ~3m   |  ~7m   | mostly due to compilation


COMMON PROBLEMS
===============

Problems with CLN
-----------------

You should use at least CLN V1.0.3, since during the development of
GiNaC various bugs have been discovered and fixed in earlier versions.
To protect you, the "configure" script checks for a feature that was
added in V1.0.3 so it won't continue with earlier versions anyhow.
Please install CLN properly on your system before continuing with
GiNaC.

Problems with building ginsh
----------------------------

The most common reason why this doesn't succeed is the absence of
libreadline and/or the corresponding header files.  Depending on what
your system/distribution is, you will have to install a package called
libreadline and maybe libreadline-dev.  If your system's vendor
doesn't supply such packages, go to <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/>
and compile it yourself.  After that it should work fine.  

If you want to build a completely static ginsh and your compiler still
complains about unresolved objects try linking with libncurses, too.


Working with the Cint C++ interpreter
=====================================

The interface to the Cint C++ interpreter is currently in an alpha
state.  Please see <http://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html> to learn about
Cint and install it before installing ginaccint.  For the tool
makecint to work properly it must know where Cint has its system
directory.  This is usually done by exporting $CINTSYSDIR to point to
the proper place.  With GiNaC you may either try to export that
variable and type
 $ ./configure --with-cint
or specify it on the command line saying
 $ ./configure --with-cint=/my/path/to/cintsysdir
Good luck!
