===================

GiNaC (which stands for "GiNaC is not a computer algebra system) is a
C++ library for symbolic mathematical calculations. It is designed to
allow the creation of integrated systems that embed symbolic manipulations
together with more established areas of computer science (like computation-
intense numeric applications, graphical interfaces, etc.) under one roof.
