* First public release.

0.4.1 (13 December 1999)
* Series Expansion of Gamma function and some other trigonometric
  functions at their poles works now.
* Many more evaluations of special functions at points where
  exact results exist.
* info_flags::rational doesn't return true for complex extensions
  any more---use info_flags::crational for the old behaviour.
  info_flags::integer and -::cinteger work similarly, the same
  holds for types like info_flags::rational_polynomial.

0.5.0 (?? February 2000)
* Expressions can be written ("archived") to files and read therefrom.
* Addition of GiNaC-cint, which lets you write complete programs in
  an interactive shell-like manner in your favoured programming
  language (C++).
