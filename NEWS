This file records noteworthy changes.

0.5.4 (15 March 2000)
* Some algorithms in class matrix (notably determinant) were replaced by
  less brain-dead ones and should now have much better performance.
* Checks were completely reorganized and split up into three parts:
  a) exams (small regression tests with predefined input)
  b) checks (lenghty coherence checks with random input)
  c) timings (for coherence and crude benchmarking)
* Behaviour of .evalf() was changed: it doesn't .evalf() any exponents.
* Expanded expressions now remember they are expanded to prevent
  superfluous expansions.

0.5.3 (23 February 2000)
* A more flexible scheme for registering functions was implemented,
  allowing for remembering, too.
* Some Bugfixes.

0.5.2 (16 February 2000)
* Mainly fixes a bug in the packaging of release 0.5.1.

0.5.1 (14 February 2000)
* Fixes a small number of bugs.

0.5.0 (7 February 2000)
* Expressions can be written ("archived") to files and read therefrom.
* Addition of GiNaC-cint, which lets you write complete programs in
  an interactive shell-like manner in your favoured programming
  language (i.e. C++).

0.4.1 (13 December 1999)
* Series Expansion of Gamma function and some other trigonometric
  functions at their poles works now.
* Many more evaluations of special functions at points where
  exact results exist.
* info_flags::rational doesn't return true for complex extensions
  any more---use info_flags::crational for the old behaviour.
  info_flags::integer and -::cinteger work similarly, the same
  holds for types like info_flags::rational_polynomial.

0.4.0 (26 November 1999)
* First public release.
