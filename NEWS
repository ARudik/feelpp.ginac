This file records noteworthy changes.

0.6.0 (11 May 2000)
* IMPORTANT: Several interface changes make programs written with GiNaC 
  much clearer but break compatibility with older versions:
  - f(x).series(x,p[,o]) -> f(x).series(x==p,o)
  - series(f(x),x,p[,o]) -> series(f(x),x==p,o)
  - gamma() -> tgamma()  (The true Gamma function, there is now also
    log(tgamma()), called lgamma(), in accord with ISO/IEC 9899:1999.)
  - EulerGamma -> Euler
* #include'ing ginac.h defines the preprocessor symbols GINACLIB_MAJOR_VERSION,
  GINACLIB_MINOR_VERSION, and GINACLIB_MICRO_VERSION with the respective GiNaC
  library version numbers.
* Expressions can be constructed from strings like this:
    ex e("2*x+y", lst(x, y));
* ex::to_rational() provides a way to extend the domain of functions like
  gcd() and divide() that only work on polynomials or rational functions (the
  good old ex::subs() method reverses this process)
* Several new timings in the check target.  Some of them may be rather rude 
  at your machine, feel free to interrupt them.

0.5.4 (15 March 2000)
* Some algorithms in class matrix (notably determinant) were replaced by
  less brain-dead ones and should now have much better performance.
* Checks were completely reorganized and split up into three parts:
  a) exams (small regression tests with predefined input)
  b) checks (lenghty coherence checks with random input)
  c) timings (for coherence and crude benchmarking)
* Behaviour of .evalf() was changed: it doesn't .evalf() any exponents.
* Expanded expressions now remember they are expanded to prevent
  superfluous expansions.
* Small bugfixes and improvements in the series expansion.

0.5.3 (23 February 2000)
* A more flexible scheme for registering functions was implemented,
  allowing for remembering, too.
* Some Bugfixes.

0.5.2 (16 February 2000)
* Mainly fixes a bug in the packaging of release 0.5.1.

0.5.1 (14 February 2000)
* Fixes a small number of bugs.

0.5.0 (7 February 2000)
* Expressions can be written ("archived") to files and read therefrom.
* Addition of GiNaC-cint, which lets you write complete programs in
  an interactive shell-like manner in your favoured programming
  language (i.e. C++).

0.4.1 (13 December 1999)
* Series Expansion of Gamma function and some other trigonometric
  functions at their poles works now.
* Many more evaluations of special functions at points where
  exact results exist.
* info_flags::rational doesn't return true for complex extensions
  any more---use info_flags::crational for the old behaviour.
  info_flags::integer and -::cinteger work similarly, the same
  holds for types like info_flags::rational_polynomial.

0.4.0 (26 November 1999)
* First public release.
